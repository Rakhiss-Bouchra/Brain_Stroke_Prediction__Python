# Brain_Stroke_Prediction__Python
Brain Stroke Prediction is an AI tool using machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person suffering from a stroke by analyzing medical history, lifestyle, and other relevant data. 
The project is developed using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as scikit-learn. The goal of the project is to improve stroke prevention and reduce the incidence of stroke-related disabilities and deaths.
